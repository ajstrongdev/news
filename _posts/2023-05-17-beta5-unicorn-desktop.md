Rhino Linux has had a fair amount of beta releases, mostly fixing smaller issues that have arisen since the first one. We are now happy to announce the release of Rhino Linux 2023.1-beta5. This beta release brings a lot of major changes to Rhino Linux, including the release of our Unicorn Desktop experience.

The Unicorn Desktop is our in-house custom XFCE experience that combines the best of the traditional and modern takes on the desktop experience. Ready to serve both powerusers and beginners alike, the Unicorn Desktop is a force to be reckoned with. Based on XFCE, this desktop experience is lightweight and fast, but 100% powerful.
